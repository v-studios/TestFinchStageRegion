I'm can't get Finch to expand ``region`` from a set of stage-specific variables.
Issue here: https://github.com/fernando-mc/serverless-finch/issues/17

For example, it should find region=us-east-1 for stage=dev::

  $ sls client deploy --stage dev
  Serverless: Deploying client to stage "dev" in region "${self:custom.region}"...

Note the lack of expansion of the region above.  It continues...

  Serverless: Bucket testfinch-dev exists
  Serverless: Listing objects in bucket testfinch-dev...
  Serverless: Deleting all objects from bucket testfinch-dev...
  Serverless: Configuring website bucket testfinch-dev...
  Serverless: Configuring policy for bucket testfinch-dev...
  Serverless: Configuring CORS policy for bucket testfinch-dev...
  Serverless: Uploading file index.html to bucket testfinch-dev...

But notice the ``undefined`` for the S3 URL which was to be mapped from the region name::

  Serverless: If successful this should be deployed at:
  Serverless: http://testfinch-dev.undefined/index.html

Using stage=prod on the invocation doesn't change anything -- we still have the ::

  $ sls client deploy --stage prod
  Serverless: Deploying client to stage "prod" in region "${self:custom.region}"...
  Serverless: Creating bucket testfinch-prod...
  Serverless: Configuring website bucket testfinch-prod...
  Serverless: Configuring policy for bucket testfinch-prod...
  Serverless: Configuring CORS policy for bucket testfinch-prod...
  Serverless: Uploading file index.html to bucket testfinch-prod...
  Serverless: If successful this should be deployed at:
  Serverless: http://testfinch-prod.undefined/index.html
